# C-Add--Copy--Convert

Hey, This is Chintz Ruparel, 

What does this Repo do?

National Stock Exchange uses a patching network for fetching Trades done under a particular code. The data once fetched is not readable. Hence it was of utmost importance to get the data into readable form as without that the data coming will be useless. This converts RAW data from Postman `Saved in a .txt file` to a CSV file for better understanding 

`National Stock Exchange ➡️ Postman ➡️ .TXT File ➡️ CSV (can also form operations)`


Add content to a text file. Copy a text file from one location to another. Convert the copied file to CSV.
